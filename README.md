# Rat Hunt (CS 3110)
Rat Hunt is a puzzlehunt website created with OCaml, Bucklescript, and Bucklescript-TEA.

Check the `INSTALL.md` file for instructions on how to build a development environment for this project, or use the Docker image to run the app without developing.

Huge shoutout to the people who developed this [Bucklescript-TEA chess tutorial](https://quernd.github.io/tutorials/tea-chess/index.html#part-i) who provided our main source of documentation for these somewhat obscure libraries.
